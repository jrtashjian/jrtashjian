### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently working at [GoDaddy](https://github.com/godaddy) on the [WordPress Experience team](https://github.com/godaddy-wordpress/) as a Senior Software Engineer.

In the past, Iâ€™ve worked as an independent contractor as well as at [Automattic](https://github.com/Automattic/), [Packet Tide](https://github.com/packettide), [10up](https://github.com/10up), and Overit. I also contribute to the [WordPress Core](https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop) and [Gutenberg](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg) Open Source projects.

If youâ€™d like to connect, you can reach me via [email](mailto:hello@jrtashjian.com) or on [Mastodon](https://talos.link/@jrtashjian).
